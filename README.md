_Formerly called Service Card Tile Feature_

Call any [action](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/) via card features. These custom features will let you create super customizable buttons, sliders, selectors, and spinboxes. [The Home Assistant developers gave us the ability to create custom features](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card/#tile-features), why is no one else taking advantage of it? And why isn't something like a generic button feature already in Home Assistant? I don't know but here it is.

# Feature Types

## Buttons

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/buttons_tile.png" alt="buttons_tile" width="600"/>

Buttons are the most basic type of custom feature, being based on the example provided in the Home Assistant developer documentation. In addition to tap actions, buttons also support double tap actions, hold actions, and an alternate momentary button mode. All of these are described in further detail below. Buttons (like most features) can be given an icon and label, and further stylized with custom CSS.

## Selectors

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/selector_tile.png" alt="selector_tile" width="600"/>

Selectors allow you to create a row of custom button features with no gaps of which the currently active one will be highlighted, similar to those available for alarm control panel and thermostat modes. Like all features in this project it can be used for any action. Selectors do not have an overall icon or label, but each option has their own appearance fields.

After adding a selector to your custom features row, you will see nothing! This is because you need to define the options to be listed out in the selector manually. Each of these options is actually a custom button feature.

This feature works best with Home Assistant `select/input_select` entities. By setting the feature entity to one of these domains and leaving autofill enabled, any options you add will automatically have the ordered option from the select entity in both the `option` and action data filled in along with the `select_option` action information. While the option fields and action information will autofill, you still have to click the add option button and give them appearance information so that they will render and be distinguishable (you'll know that you've added all possible options when the last option you add has the text `Option` instead of a different value).

Since each selector option is a custom feature button, you can override it's default behavior by changing it's tap action. Doing so will also break the default current option highlighting logic, but you can use the `Option` field within an option alongside to restore this. `Option` will be the value to compare against the feature's value, whether that is it's entity's state or one of it's attributes. If they match and are not undefined, then the the option will be highlighted. The option highlight color defaults to the parent card color (usually the tile card color), but can be changed by setting the CSS attribute `--color` to a different value, either for the entire feature or an individual option.

## Sliders

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/slider_tile.png" alt="slider_tile" width="600"/>

Sliders are input range elements made to look similar to the sliders found in Home Assistant default card features, similar to those available for light brightness and temperature. By default the slider will look like a normal tile light brightness or cover position slider, but you can change this to a few of other thumb styles using the `Thumb Type` appearance option.

Sliders can track either the state or attribute of an entity, meaning that when that entity's state or attribute changes so will the slider to match. By default it will track the `state` of an entity. To change this, set `Attribute` to the name of the attribute you want the slider to track. In order to pass the the slider's value to an action, set the value in the action data to `{{ value | float }}`.

By default the slider's range will be from 0 to 100, with a step size of 1. You will need to adjust this depending on the action you are calling. If you find that the action you are calling does not like non-whole numbers (like `light.turn_on` with `color_temp`) in it's data, make sure to set step size to a whole number and to use the `int` filter in the action data template.

To prevent value bouncing, sliders will wait for one second before retreiving an updated value from Home Assistant after it's action is called. This time can be changed by changing `Update after action delay`.

## Spinboxes

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/spinbox_tile.png" alt="spinbox_tile" width="600"/>

Spinboxes allow you to create Home Assistant style number boxes with increment and decrement buttons, similar to the climate target temperature feature. By default the user can increment or decrement this feature's internal value using the corresponding buttons. Once the user stops pressing the buttons for a time period defined by `Debounce time` (default 1000ms), the user defined tap action will fire. Similar to sliders, spinboxes will wait one second before updating it's internal value but this can be changed using `Update after action delay`.

Like sliders, the spinbox's action should use an action which sets a value similar to `number/input_number.set_value` or `climate.set_temperature` and the user should use `value` in a template to pass it to the action call. This way the user can keep incrementing or decrementing the value until they reach the desired value, and the action to update it in Home Assistant is only called once. You can make this features buttons repeat when held by setting the hold action to repeat. These should all be set in the `CENTER` tab of the spinbox configuration page.

You can also override the default behavior of the increment and decrement buttons by changing the tab bar to `INCREMENT` or `DECREMENT` and modifying the actions there. Doing so will disable the normal increment/decrement and debounce button behavior and create a button feature instead. Spinbox button appearance and styles can also be modified more directly in the `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT` tabs.

# How To Use

This project now has a fully featured configuration user interface! To get started, install this project using HACS by adding it as a custom frontend repository. Then go to a dashboard.

Create a tile card, or any other card that supports card features. The entity ID can be anything you like. Click `ADD FEATURE` and then `Custom Features Row`

All custom features are encapsulated in a custom features row. This allows you to add multiple custom features to a row, apply overall CSS styles, and change the widths of features in the row relative to each other using the `flex-basis` CSS property. You can add a custom features row just like any default feature, except that this feature is available for all entities.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/add_custom_features_row.png" alt="add_custom_features_row" width="600"/>

Within a custom features row you can add individual features using the add custom feature button. This works just like the top level add feature button but just for custom features. Each feature will look like a blank rectangle to start. Features can be reordered, copied, edited, and deleted from here.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/add_custom_feature.png" alt="add_custom_feature" width="600"/>

You can also add CSS styles for the entire row here. CSS styles have to be encapsulated in a CSS selector like so.

```css
:host {
  --mdc-icon-size: 32px;
}
```

By default, features will autofill with it's parent's entity information for tracking it's internal state. This can be disabled by toggling `Autofill` off at the feature level. Haptics can be similary enabled for a feature.

## General Options

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/basic_feature_options.png" alt="basic_feature_options" width="600"/>

Every feature can have an entity assigned to it, which is used to track it's internal value. This value can then be used in styles and actions using templates, like `{{ value | float }}` By default the value will be derived from the entity state, but it can be changed to an attribute use the corresponding field.

Some additional logic is applied for certain attributes:

- `brightness` - Converted from the default range of 0-255 to 0-100.
- `media_position` - Updated twice a second using the current timestamp and the attribute `media_position_updated_at` when the entity state is `playing`, and locked to a max value using the attribute `media_duration`.
- `elapsed` - Only for timer entities. Updated twice a second using the the current timestamp and the attributes `duration`, `remaining`, and `finishes_at`, and locked to a max value using the attribute `duration`.
  - _NOTE_: `elapsed` is not an actual attribute of timer entities, but is a possible `value_attribute` for timer entities for the purpose of displaying accurate timer elapsed values. Timer entities do have an attribute `remaining`, which only updates when the timer state changes. The actual `remaining` attribute can be calculated using the `elapsed` value and the timer `duration` attribute.

If you find that the autofilling of the entity ID in the action or tile feature value is causing issues, setting `Autofill` to `false` may help. Just remember to set the entity ID of the feature and the entity, device, area, or label ID of the action target.

Haptics are disabled for features by default, but can be toggled on at the feature level.

### Slider and Spinbox General Options

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/slider_spinbox_general_options.png" alt="slider_spinbox_general_options" width="600"/>

Sliders and spinboxes have some additional general options. Both can have range `Min` and `Max` values defined by the user, but default to 0 and 100. Both can also have a `Step` size defined, which defaults to 1.

Sliders and spinboxes will wait one second before updating their internal values from Home Assistant. This time can be changed by setting `Update after action delay`. Spinboxes will wait to fire their actions until a set amount of time after their buttons have stopped being pressed. This time defaults to one second and can be changed by setting `Debounce time`.

### Selector General Options

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/selector_general_options.png" alt="selector_general_options" width="600"/>

Selectors are made up of option buttons, which can be added to, reordered, copied, deleted, and edited from a list similar to the overall features or custom features in a row.

Like sliders and spinboxes, selectors have a one second delay before updating their internal values from Home Assistant, which can be adjusted using `Update after action delay`.

## Appearance

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/appearance_options.png" alt="appearance_options" width="600"/>

All features (except for selectors, which support these options at the option level) can have a `Label`, `Icon`, and `Units`. These fields can also be set using templates. Like the overall custom features row, each custom feature can have it's CSS styles set (including using templates).

### A Note on Templating

Almost all fields support nunjucks templating. Nunjucks is a templating engine for JavaScript, which is heavily based on the jinja2 templating engine for Python which Home Assistant uses. While the syntax of nunjucks and jinja2 is almost identical, you may find the [nunjucks documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) useful. Most extensions supported by Home Assistant templates are supported by this templating system, but not all and the syntax may vary. Please see the [ha-nunjucks](https://github.com/Nerwyn/ha-nunjucks) repository for a list of available extensions. If you want additional extensions to be added or have templating questions or bugs, please make an issue or discussion on that repository, not this one.

You can include the current value of a tile feature and it's units by using the variables `value` and `unit` in a label template. You can also include `hold_secs` in a template if performing a momentary end action. Each custom feature can also reference it's entry using `config` within templates. `config.entity` and `config.attribute` will return the features entity ID and attribute with their templates rendered (if they have them), and other templated config fields can be rendered within templates by wrapping them in the function `render` within a template.

### CSS Styles

The custom features row and each custom feature within it has a code box for entering [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) styles.

General style options and custom feature specific properties can be set within the `:host` selector. **You cannot set styles outside of a CSS selector**.

```css
:host {
  --color: red;
  --icon-color: blue;
  flex-basis: 200%;
}
```

All sub-elements within a custom feature are given easy to remember classes to apply additional styles to.

| Class Name  | Element                                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .row        | The custom features row that all custom features are contained within.      |
| .container  | A container within the custom feature to keep things organized.             |
| .background | The background of the custom feature.                                       |
| .icon       | The icon of the custom feature.                                             |
| .label      | The label of the custom feature.                                            |
| .slider     | The input range slider element.                                             |
| .tooltip    | The slider tooltip, which appears when the slider is being interacted with. |

```css
.background {
  background: blue;
}
.icon {
  --mdc-icon-size: 32px;
}
.label {
  color: red;
}
.tooltip {
  --tooltip-label: '{{ (value / 60) | int }}:{{ 0 if (value - 60*((value / 60) | int)) < 10 else "" }}{{ (value - 60*((value / 60) | int)) | int }}';
}
```

While any CSS property can be used, these values are internal CSS attributes used by custom features. You can choose to either use these values or to set these fields directly using class selectors for each sub-element.

| Name                     | Description                                                                                             |

| --color                  | Color of the custom feature. Can also be a CSS function.                                                |
| --opacity                | Opacity of the custom feature. Defaults to 0.2.                                                         |

#### Slider CSS Attributes

| Name                  | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --thumb-width         | Width of the actual slider thumb, not including box shadow. Default varies by thumb style and browser. |
| --thumb-border-radius | Border radius of the slider thumb. Default varies by thumb style.                                      |
| --thumb-box-shadow    | Box shadow of the slider thumb. Default varies by thumb style.                                         |
| --tooltip-label       | Tooltip label template, defaults to `{{ value }}{{ unit }}`.                                           |
| --tooltip-transform   | Tooltip location transform function, defaults to `translate(var(--thumb-offset), -35px)`.              |
| --tooltip-display     | Tooltip display value, set to `none` to hide tooltip, defaults to `initial`.                           |

## Selector CSS Attributes

| Name            | Description                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| --color         | The hover and selected color of an option.   |
| --hover-opacity | Opacity to use when hovering over an option. |

## Actions

There are three traditional ways to trigger an action - tap, double tap, and hold. Buttons, selector options, and spinbox buttons support all three, and sliders only support tap actions. Defining a double tap action that is not `none` introduces a 200ms delay to single tap actions.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/button_actions_options.png" alt="button_actions_options" width="600"/>

Each action also supports the `confirmation` field. More information on Home Assistant action confirmations can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/#options-for-confirmation).

When setting the action for a slider or spinbox, you must use `value` within a template in the action data to use the feature value in action. For convenience, a codebox for the action will be displayed below the normal action options.

### Action Types

Actions follow the [Home Assistant actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/) syntax. All Home Assistant actions are supported along with some additional ones.

| Action         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Adjustable Timings

Double tap and hold actions have user adjustable timings to change how they are triggered.

#### Hold Time

Hold actions are triggered by holding down on a button for a defined amount of time and then releasing. The default amount of time is 500ms. You can change this by setting `Hold time` in the hold action to a different number.

#### Repeat and Repeat Delay

By setting a hold action to `repeat`, the tap action will repeat while the button is held down. The default delay between repeats is 100ms. You can change this by setting `Repeat delay` in the hold action to a different number. See the below section on [repeat](#repeat) for more.

#### Double Tap Window

Double tap actions have a default window of 200ms to trigger before a single tap action is triggered instead. You can change this by setting `Double tap window` in the double tap action to a different number.

**NOTE**: Setting `Double tap window` above or too close to `Hold time` can result in undesirable behavior, as the hold timer expires before the double tap timer does. If you increase the `Double tap window` you should also increase `Hold time` to not be too close to it by at least 100ms if not more. In a custom feature without a hold action defined, you can set `Hold behavior` explicitly to `Nothing` to render the `Hold time` field.

### Momentary Button mode

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/main/assets/momentary_actions_options.png" alt="momentary_actions_options" width="600"/>

As an alternative to normal tap, hold, and double tap actions, buttons, including those within selectors and spinboxes, can also be used in a momentary mode. Configuring this option disables the normal tap, hold, and double tap actions.

The momentary start action is fired when you first press down on a button. The momentary end action is fired when you release the button. While these are meant to be used together you can use one or the other.

You can include the number of seconds a button has been held down using `hold_secs` in a template. For convenience, the momentary end action YAML is included in a code box below the action, like shown above.

# YAML Examples

While all configuration can now be done through the user interface, these YAML examples can provide some insight on how to do some advanced styling and templating.

## Example 1

A lock tile with lock and unlock selector options

```yaml
